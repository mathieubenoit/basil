  - multiple basic modules (SPI, SEQ)
  - multiple interfaces (UART, USB2, USB3, Ethernet)
Software:
  - layer structure following hardware
  - generation based on yaml file
  - register abstract layer (RAL)
  - simulator interface allows software test against simulated RTL (thanks to `cocotb <https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb>`_ )
